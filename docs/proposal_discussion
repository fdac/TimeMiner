Proposal Discussion
11-3-14

Things to consider:

Unique vs cyclical events - Will this system catch repeated events, such as
    Presidential elections or Christmas?

Cause and effect events - If one event causes another separated by some time
    interval, will they be clustered together? Should they be clustered
    together?

Narrow scope - Time wise narrow, ie only analyzing a month/year/event
    Narrow parameters for analyzation, eg only page views, common words, and
    common references.
